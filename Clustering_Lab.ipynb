The final silhouette score (k=2) for the single linkage was far higher at 0.6295 than 0.3039 for the final two clusters of complete linkage. Single linkage create long, linear clusters, while complete linkage created more spherical clusters. The highest respective silhouette score for single and complete linkages were achieved at 2 clusters, which is fewer than the known number of true categories. I would have expected the highest silhouette scores to be achieved at 3 clusters, but I was wrong."
